# About the project
This project is a tutorial made by [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hYYGbV60Vq3IXYNfDk8At1)
The tutorial video of this project is divided in 2 videos: 
- [video1](https://youtu.be/juocv4AtrHo)
- [video2](https://youtu.be/7iDGJolHFmU)

The project is a tutorial about learning vue 3 JS with the Option API by creating
a jobs board website using the Vue Router and fetching data using json-server.

*ps: json-server didn't work for me as the video is made in 2020. At the moment 
of writing this readme file (04/25/2023), json-server has vulnerabilities that
cannot be fixed, so I followed along even though the json-server isn't installed
for my project*

# Link Preview
There is no link preview since json-server doesn't work for me, there will be
some errors. The code is not wrong apart from the endpoint of the fetch, which
doesn't really exist (follow-along the tutorial video).

The project is only used for educational purposes and for personal purposes.

Huge thanks to The Net Ninja for this tutorial.

# What I learnt 

I learnt about the Vue Router and how to fetch data using components and 
conditionals to render changes in real-time. The Vue Router contains parameters
that make it simple to do redirections, 404 pages and more. Fetching data is 
easy when using a simple database file like json-server. I learnt more about 
javascript basics in the API section like promises.
